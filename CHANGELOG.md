## [2.1.2] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- Removed `disable-model-invocation: true` from all skills so they are registered as invocable by Claude Code (e.g. `/learning-dna:new-topic` now works)
- Cleaned up stale `disable-model-invocation` references in `new-topic` and `research` skill instructions

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- Removed invalid `PreCommit` hook event from `hooks/hooks.json` that caused plugin to fail loading with "Failed to load hooks" error on every session start

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- `/learning-dna:deploy` skill — guided deployment to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel (all free)
  - Interactive platform selection with pros/cons for each option
  - GitHub Pages: GitHub Actions workflow or manual `gh-pages` deploy, HashRouter or 404-redirect routing strategy
  - Netlify: drag-and-drop, CLI, or Git integration deployment methods
  - Vercel: CLI or Git integration deployment methods
  - Automatic Vite `base` path configuration per platform
  - SPA routing config generation (`netlify.toml`, `vercel.json`, or `404.html`)
  - Post-deploy verification via WebFetch
  - Idempotent re-runs — detects existing deployment config and skips to rebuild/redeploy
- Deploy prompt shown after successful app build in `new-topic` and `build-app` skills

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Structure-first application setup — directory layout and TypeScript types created before any components
- React Context data model (`LearningContext`) replacing all localStorage state management
- IndexedDB data loader for persistent storage (topics, progress, quiz results, TTS settings)
- Top navbar with "Topics" and "Quiz" navigation buttons (responsive hamburger on mobile)
- Welcome/home page for multi-knowledge-base switching with topic cards showing progress
- Quiz status page showing all topics' quiz progress, scores, and difficulty breakdown
- `app-validator` agent for pre-build validation of structure, components, routing, and data model
- Application validation step (Step 10) — build, component, routing, and data model checks before topic scaffolding
- localStorage to IndexedDB migration on first load for v1.x generated apps

### Changed
- `build-app` skill restructured: 12-step flow (was 5 steps) with structure-first approach
- TTS specifications extracted into reusable component section (`TTSReader` + `useTTS` hook)
- Sidebar reads progress from React Context / IndexedDB instead of localStorage
- TTS settings persistence moved from localStorage to IndexedDB `ttsSettings` object store
- Footer text updated: "Built with Learning DNA" (linked to repo, no emoji)
- `new-topic` skill Step 7 updated to follow full build-app flow including welcome page
- `new-topic` skill Step 8 updated with welcome page verification
- Plugin version bumped to 2.0.0

### Breaking
- Generated apps now use IndexedDB instead of localStorage for all persistence (migration included)
- Application directory structure changed — new `components/`, `contexts/`, `hooks/`, `pages/`, `types/`, `lib/` directories under `src/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- Paragraph-level TTS read buttons — each `<p>` gets a speaker icon on hover, plus a "Read All" button for full-page reading
- TTS speed presets — "Slow & Clear" (0.7x), "Normal" (1x), "Fast" (1.5x), "Speed Reader" (2x) quick-select chips
- Volume control slider for TTS playback
- "Preview Voice" button — hear a sample sentence before selecting a voice
- Per-topic TTS settings persistence in localStorage
- Reading progress visual feedback — sentence highlighting, progress bar, and auto-scroll during TTS playback
- Keyboard shortcuts for TTS — Space (play/pause), Escape (stop), `[`/`]` (speed), N/P (navigate sections)
- DNA-driven TTS defaults — learner type sets default speed, language drives voice ranking, content depth affects pause behavior
- Side menu with progress tracking — collapsible sidebar showing subtopic completion, quiz scores, and overall progress
- Subtopic completion tracking via IntersectionObserver (scroll-to-bottom detection)
- Quiz score display in sidebar with difficulty breakdown

### Changed
- TTS voice ranking now prioritizes "Natural" > "Enhanced" > "Premium" > default system voices
- Build-app skill spec expanded with detailed TTS, keyboard shortcuts, and sidebar specifications

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- Initial release of the Learning DNA plugin for Claude Code
- `/learning-dna:new-topic` skill — create topics with mandatory DNA setup
- `/learning-dna:research` skill — research subtopics from web sources
- `/learning-dna:add-quizzes` skill — generate quizzes shaped by DNA
- `/learning-dna:build-app` skill — scaffold React learning app
- `content-reviewer` agent — validates learning materials quality
- `quiz-improver` agent — improves quiz question quality
- `topic-expander` agent — suggests subtopics and learning paths
- Pre-commit review hook with 3-iteration quality loop
- 8-dimension Learning DNA system (Language, Learner Type, Content Depth, Example Style, Visualization, Testing Frequency, Knowledge Level, Learning Goal)
